### 1. What is Lyvora?

Lyvora is a decentralized marketplace for physical products.

Unlike traditional platforms like Amazon or Mercado Libre, Lyvora has no central authority. It runs on code and smart contracts, and users have full control over their accounts, listings, and payments.

No middlemen, no hidden fees, no arbitrary restrictions.

---

### 2. Is Lyvora an online store or a shopping app?

No. Lyvora is not a store.

It‚Äôs a decentralized platform where anyone can open their own store and sell physical products directly to buyers using crypto.

---

### 3. What are the fees?

Lyvora charges only 2.5% per sale.

There are no monthly fees, no withdrawal fees, and no category-based charges. Full transparency.

---

### 4. Do I need to complete KYC?

No. Lyvora is a KYC-free platform.

You only need a crypto wallet to connect and start using it.

---

### 5. What cryptocurrencies can I use to pay?

Initially, payments will be supported in SUI and stablecoins like USDC.

Soon after launch, Lyvora will introduce its own native token, $LYV, which will be used for payments, cashback, governance, premium features, and more.

---

### 6. Is it just for digital products or also physical ones?

Lyvora was built specifically for physical products.

In the future, it may support digital goods and services, but the main focus is on real-world commerce.

---

### 7. How are payments secured?

All payments are held in a smart contract escrow.

Funds are only released to the seller once delivery is confirmed.

If there‚Äôs a dispute, Lyvora‚Äôs on-chain system ensures transparent and fair resolution with no centralized authority.

---

### 8. How does seller reputation work?

Every wallet has a public on-chain reputation profile.

It‚Äôs based on factors like successful deliveries, response time, dispute outcomes, and direct feedback.

This builds trust and helps users identify reliable sellers.

---

### 9. Is Lyvora already live?

Not yet.

Lyvora is currently under development.

The official documents and landing page are live, and the testnet launch is planned for late 2025.

---

### 10. Will Lyvora have its own token?

Yes. Lyvora will launch a native token called $LYV.

It will be used for platform payments, cashback rewards, staking, governance, and future upgrades.

Token distribution will prioritize real users, not bots.

---

### 11. Is there an airdrop?

There is no airdrop currently confirmed.

Lyvora is still self-funded and focused on product development and fundraising.

If an airdrop happens, it will be for real users only, based on actual platform usage, not task farming.

---

### 12. What blockchain does Lyvora use?

Lyvora is being built on the SUI blockchain. It is a fast, low-cost, and scalable network designed for real-world applications.

## Web3 Terms ‚Äî Explained for Beginners

**Decentralized**  
There‚Äôs no company or single person in control. Instead, everything runs automatically through smart contracts. These are transparent pieces of code that enforce the rules. No middlemen. No gatekeepers.

**Wallet**  
A wallet is your account.  
It lets you log in, send and receive crypto, and store your digital assets, all in one place. You don‚Äôt need an email or password. Just connect it and you‚Äôre ready.

**Smart Contract**  
A smart contract is a program that runs on the blockchain.  
It automatically executes agreements between people. For example: "Release payment only if the buyer receives the product."

**Escrow**  
An escrow holds funds in a safe middle zone until both buyer and seller meet their part of the deal.  
Lyvora uses smart contract escrow. There‚Äôs no need for a third party.

**On-chain**  
Anything that happens on-chain is public, verifiable, and immutable.  
Transactions, reputations, and actions are recorded on the blockchain and cannot be edited or deleted.

**DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)**  
A DAO is a group of people who make decisions together using votes, often with tokens.  
Lyvora may activate DAO governance in future phases, giving users a voice in platform decisions.

**Airdrop**  
An airdrop is a free token distribution. It usually rewards early users or contributors.  
But in Web3, real activity matters ‚Äî not just clicking tasks.

**Gas Fee**  
This is the small cost you pay to make a transaction on a blockchain.  
It goes to the network validators, not to Lyvora.  
SUI, for example, has very low gas fees.
