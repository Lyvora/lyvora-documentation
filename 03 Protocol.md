#  Protocol
The Lyvora protocol was designed to combine the benefits of decentralization with the practicality required for trading physical products. It addresses key failures found in traditional platforms, such as high fees, arbitrary account restrictions, and invasive data collection.

Through auditable smart contracts and an automatic escrow custody system, Lyvora enables secure transactions without financial intermediaries. At the same time, it transparently integrates SaaS logistics services to enable real-world delivery and tracking.

### The protocol’s philosophy combines:

* Autonomy: users have full control over their funds and data.

* Transparency: all financial stages are publicly auditable on-chain.

* Privacy: only essential data is stored off-chain.

* Efficiency: low fees and a streamlined process.

 # Transaction Flow

### Step-by-Step 
1. Wallet Connection
Users access the platform by connecting their crypto wallet.
No KYC or traditional account creation is required.

2. Product Selection
Buyers browse listings and select a product.
Prices are shown in USD for international clarity.

3. Internal Chat
Buyers can message sellers to negotiate.
Finalized offers generate IPFS hashes linked on-chain for integrity.

4. Payment
Buyers complete the purchase using SUI, compatible stablecoins, or $LYV.
Payments can be made via QR code or connected wallet.

5. Escrow Lock
Funds are automatically locked in the smart contract escrow system.

6. Shipping & Tracking
The system integrates with logistics APIs to register tracking data.

7. Shipping Notification
The buyer is notified when the product is shipped.

8. Live Delivery Monitoring
Delivery progress is monitored automatically via API or oracle.

9. Delivery Confirmation (System-Detected)
When the delivery is confirmed by the logistics provider or oracle, the order is marked as "Delivered."

10. 48-Hour Review Window Begins
A review window opens automatically.
During this time, the buyer can take action if needed.

11. Buyer Action
The buyer may:
- Manually confirm receipt → funds are released immediately to the seller.

- Open a dispute if there is a problem (e.g., wrong or damaged product).

- Take no action → funds are automatically released to the seller after 48 hours.

12. Feedback & Ratings
After settlement, both buyer and seller can leave feedback.
All reputation data is stored immutably on-chain.

13. Cashback & Rewards
Buyers receive cashback or token-based rewards based on campaign rules.

 **Scalability and Efficiency**

The entire flow is designed to operate with **low transaction fees** and high scalability, supporting thousands of users simultaneously.

# Escrow Module
The escrow system is the protocol’s core security mechanism.

How it works:
## Detailed characteristics:

- Each transaction generates a unique escrow ID linked to buyer and seller wallets.

- Funds remain locked until one of the following occurs:

- Buyer manually confirms receipt.

- The 48-hour window expires with no action taken.

- A dispute is opened by the buyer.

- If no shipping activity is detected within 2 business days after payment, the system automatically refunds the buyer.

- Accepted tokens: SUI, compatible stablecoins, and $LYV.

- Product prices are displayed in USD. Conversions use oracle-based real-time exchange rates.
### Accepted tokens:

- SUI

- Supported stablecoins

- $LYV (Lyvora’s native token), which offers exclusive benefits.

  # Tracking and Logistics System
- Integrates with trusted logistics providers via SaaS APIs.

- Shipping costs are automatically calculated at checkout.

- Tracking codes and shipping labels are generated within the platform.

- Real-time delivery updates are visible in the buyer’s dashboard.

### Privacy Note:
Tracking data and shipping addresses are stored off-chain. Optionally, a cryptographic hash of this data may be stored on-chain to preserve integrity.
# Dispute Resolution 
Buyers can open disputes if the delivered product is incorrect, damaged, or incomplete.

### Dispute Flow:

- Buyer submits a reason and evidence (photos, videos, messages).

- Seller has 48 hours to respond or submit counter-evidence.

- The smart contract evaluates the evidence using transparent, weighted logic.

- If both sides submit inconclusive evidence, on-chain reputation is used as a tiebreaker.

- Disputes may be escalated to a decentralized DAO arbitration mechanism in the future.

- Final decisions are enforced by the contract, and reputations are updated accordingly.


  #  Reputation System
  ### Each wallet address has a public on-chain reputation profile.

- Metrics include:

- Number of completed transactions.

- Disputes and outcomes.

- Response times.

- Peer feedback from other verified users.

### Key features:

- Reputation is non-transferable.

- New wallets are labeled "No History."

- Reputation manipulation and Sybil attacks are discouraged through behavioral pattern detection and transparent history.


 # On-Chain Events
### The protocol emits public on-chain events such as:

- Escrow creation

- Payment updates

- Dispute initiation and resolution

- Feedback and ratings

These events ensure full transparency and public auditability.
# Future Roadmap: Oracle Integration
Currently, delivery confirmation is handled through SaaS API integrations with logistics partners. In the future, Lyvora will integrate decentralized oracle providers compatible with the SUI blockchain to bring delivery confirmations fully on-chain.

### Oracles will be used to:

- Confirm delivery events and status updates.

- Submit verifiable tracking data.

- Calculate real-time exchange rates.

This enhances transparency and automates escrow logic without relying on manual intervention.



# $LYV Token – Present and Future Uses
### In addition to cashback, the $LYV token has multiple uses:

- Discounted fee payments

- Staking to unlock premium features

- Participation in governance

- Earning rewards for activity

- Reputation NFTs and profile upgrades

The $LYV token aligns incentives across buyers, sellers, and contributors.


  # Security and Audits
Security is a core part of the protocol’s design:

- Open-source smart contracts audited by independent security firms.

- Immutable contract logic after deployment.

- Multisig wallets for treasury funds.

- On-chain timers control all deadlines.

- Fallback logic ensures refunds in case of failure.

- Replay protection and unique escrow identifiers.

- Public bug bounty program planned for testnet phase.
