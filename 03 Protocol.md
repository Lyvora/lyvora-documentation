#  Protocol
The Lyvora protocol was designed to combine the benefits of decentralization with the practicality required for trading physical products. It addresses common issues found in traditional platforms, such as high fees, arbitrary account freezes, and excessive collection of personal data.

Through auditable smart contracts and an automatic escrow custody system, Lyvora enables secure transactions without financial intermediaries. At the same time, it transparently integrates SaaS logistics services, making real-world delivery and tracking possible.

### The protocol‚Äôs philosophy combines:

* Autonomy: users have full control over their funds and data.

* Transparency: all financial stages are publicly auditable on-chain.

* Privacy: only essential data is stored off-chain.

* Efficiency: low fees and a streamlined process.

# Escrow Module

Escrow is the central security component of the protocol.

## Detailed characteristics:

- Each transaction generates a unique ID linked to the buyer‚Äôs and seller‚Äôs wallet addresses and the purchased product.

- Funds are automatically locked in the smart contract.

- Release occurs only after one of the following conditions:

- Explicit confirmation by the buyer:
Once the delivery status is ‚ÄúDelivered,‚Äù the buyer manually confirms receipt in the Lyvora dashboard. The system displays verification prompts:

‚ÄúAre you sure the product is correct?‚Äù
‚ÄúPlease double-check before confirming.‚Äù
If confirmed, payment is released immediately.

- Opening a dispute:
If the buyer detects an issue, they can open a dispute within the 48-hour window. Before proceeding, the system asks them to select a reason and confirm the action.

- Expiration of the review period:
If the buyer takes no action within 48 hours, the contract automatically releases the payment to the seller.

### Accepted tokens:

- SUI

- Supported stablecoins

- $LYV (Lyvora‚Äôs native token), which offers exclusive benefits.

  # Tracking and Logistics System
  The logistics layer operates via SaaS integrations connected to Lyvora‚Äôs backend.
  ### Features:

- Automatic shipping cost calculation at checkout.

- Generation of ready-to-print shipping labels.

- Periodic status updates synchronized with the buyer‚Äôs dashboard.

- Real-time delivery tracking.

Privacy Note:
Tracking information and shipping addresses are not stored on-chain. They remain securely in the platform‚Äôs backend database. Optionally, a cryptographic hash of this data can be saved on-chain as proof of integrity.
# Dispute Resolution 
### Flow:

- The buyer opens a dispute and submits evidence.

- The seller has up to 48 hours to respond.

- The decision is made based on predefined rules or mediation.

- The outcome determines whether funds are released or refunded.

- Reputation is updated on-chain.

- The detailed return process will be defined later.

  #  Reputation System
  ### Each wallet maintains an immutable history that includes:

- Completed transactions.

- Disputes and outcomes.

- Ratings received.

-Trust indicators.

In the future, the protocol may issue reputation NFTs to attest to user credibility.
 # On-Chain Events
### Events emitted by the protocol include:

- Escrow creation.

- Payment status updates.
 
- Dispute initiation and resolution.

- Ratings recorded.

These events enable public auditability and transparency.
# Future Roadmap: Oracle Integration
Currently, delivery confirmation relies on SaaS API integrations. In the future, support for public oracles (such as Chainlink and Supra Oracles) will be considered to record delivery confirmations directly on-chain. At this time, none of these solutions offer official support for SUI, but we will monitor ecosystem developments. As an alternative, Lyvora may develop its own proprietary oracle.

# $LYV Token ‚Äì Present and Future Uses
### In addition to cashback, the $LYV token has strategic purposes:

- Governance: voting on proposals.

- Staking: participating in incentive pools.

- Progressive discounts: reducing fees based on staking and token usage.
  # Security and Audits
- Smart contracts audited by independent entities.

- Contracts immutable after deployment.

- Automatic refund fallback in case of failures.

- Multi-signature wallets for treasury funds.

- Bug bounty program planned before mainnet launch.
