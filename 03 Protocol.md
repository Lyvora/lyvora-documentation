#  Protocol
The Lyvora protocol was designed to combine the benefits of decentralization with the practicality required for trading physical products. It addresses key failures found in traditional platforms, such as high fees, arbitrary account restrictions, and invasive data collection.

Through auditable smart contracts and an automatic escrow custody system, Lyvora enables secure transactions without financial intermediaries. At the same time, it transparently integrates SaaS logistics services to enable real-world delivery and tracking.

### The protocol’s philosophy combines:

* Autonomy: users have full control over their funds and data.

* Transparency: all financial stages are publicly auditable on-chain.

* Privacy: only essential data is stored off-chain.

* Efficiency: low fees and a streamlined process.

 # Transaction Flow

### Step-by-Step 
1. Wallet Connection
Users access the platform by connecting their crypto wallet.
No KYC or traditional account creation is required.

2. Product Selection
Buyers browse listings and select a product.
Prices are shown in USD for international clarity.

3. Internal Chat
Buyers can message sellers to negotiate.
Finalized offers generate IPFS hashes linked on-chain for integrity.

4. Payment
Buyers complete the purchase using SUI, compatible stablecoins, or $LYV.
Payments can be made via QR code or connected wallet.

5. Escrow Lock
Funds are automatically locked in the smart contract escrow system.

6. Shipping & Tracking
The system integrates with logistics APIs to register tracking data.

7. Shipping Notification
The buyer is notified when the product is shipped.

8. Live Delivery Monitoring
Delivery progress is monitored automatically via API or oracle.

9. Delivery Confirmation (System-Detected)
When the delivery is confirmed by the logistics provider or oracle, the order is marked as "Delivered."

10. 48-Hour Review Window Begins
A review window opens automatically.
During this time, the buyer can take action if needed.

11. Buyer Action
The buyer may:
- Manually confirm receipt → funds are released immediately to the seller.

- Open a dispute if there is a problem (e.g., wrong or damaged product).

- Take no action → funds are automatically released to the seller after 48 hours.

12. Feedback & Ratings
After settlement, both buyer and seller can leave feedback.
All reputation data is stored immutably on-chain.

13. Cashback & Rewards
Buyers receive cashback or token-based rewards based on campaign rules.

 **Scalability and Efficiency**

The entire flow is designed to operate with **low transaction fees** and high scalability, supporting thousands of users simultaneously.

# Escrow Module
The escrow system is the protocol’s core security mechanism.

How it works:
## Detailed characteristics:

- Each transaction generates a unique ID linked to the buyer’s and seller’s wallet addresses and the purchased product.

- Funds are automatically locked in the smart contract.

- Release occurs only after one of the following conditions:

- Explicit confirmation by the buyer:
Once the delivery status is “Delivered,” the buyer manually confirms receipt in the Lyvora dashboard. The system displays verification prompts:

“Are you sure the product is correct?”
“Please double-check before confirming.”
If confirmed, payment is released immediately.

- Opening a dispute:
If the buyer detects an issue, they can open a dispute within the 48-hour window. Before proceeding, the system asks them to select a reason and confirm the action.

- Expiration of the review period:
If the buyer takes no action within 48 hours, the contract automatically releases the payment to the seller.

### Accepted tokens:

- SUI

- Supported stablecoins

- $LYV (Lyvora’s native token), which offers exclusive benefits.

  # Tracking and Logistics System
  The logistics layer operates via SaaS integrations connected to Lyvora’s backend.
  ### Features:

- Automatic shipping cost calculation at checkout.

- Generation of ready-to-print shipping labels.

- Periodic status updates synchronized with the buyer’s dashboard.

- Real-time delivery tracking.

Privacy Note:
Tracking information and shipping addresses are not stored on-chain. They remain securely in the platform’s backend database. Optionally, a cryptographic hash of this data can be saved on-chain as proof of integrity.
# Dispute Resolution 
### Flow:

- The buyer opens a dispute and submits evidence.

- The seller has up to 48 hours to respond.

- The decision is made based on predefined rules or mediation.

- The outcome determines whether funds are released or refunded.

- Reputation is updated on-chain.

- The detailed return process will be defined later.

  #  Reputation System
  ### Each wallet maintains an immutable history that includes:

- Completed transactions.

- Disputes and outcomes.

- Ratings received.

-Trust indicators.

In the future, the protocol may issue reputation NFTs to attest to user credibility.
 # On-Chain Events
### Events emitted by the protocol include:

- Escrow creation.

- Payment status updates.
 
- Dispute initiation and resolution.

- Ratings recorded.

These events enable public auditability and transparency.
# Future Roadmap: Oracle Integration
Currently, delivery confirmation is handled through SaaS API integrations with logistics partners. In the future, Lyvora will integrate decentralized oracle providers compatible with the SUI blockchain to bring delivery confirmations fully on-chain.

### Oracles will be used to:

- Confirm delivery events and status updates.

- Submit verifiable tracking data.

- Calculate real-time exchange rates.

This enhances transparency and automates escrow logic without relying on manual intervention.



# $LYV Token – Present and Future Uses
### In addition to cashback, the $LYV token has strategic purposes:

- Governance: voting on proposals.

- Staking: participating in incentive pools.

- Progressive discounts: reducing fees based on staking and token usage.
  # Security and Audits
- Smart contracts audited by independent entities.

- Contracts immutable after deployment.

- Automatic refund fallback in case of failures.

- Multi-signature wallets for treasury funds.

- Bug bounty program planned before mainnet launch.
