# Architecture
Lyvora’s architecture is built to bridge decentralized financial logic with real-world commerce. It follows a hybrid model that combines on-chain value flows with off-chain service integrations. Enabling global transactions for physical products while preserving the core principles of Web3: trustlessness, transparency, and user autonomy.
# 1. Overview
Lyvora enables decentralized buying and selling of physical goods by separating two distinct layers:

- On-chain layer: Where funds, escrow logic, reputation, and dispute processes are recorded and executed via smart contracts on the SUI blockchain.

- Off-chain service layer: Where logistics, tracking data, and shipping operations are handled via external SaaS providers.

### This architecture ensures that:

- All financial actions are trustless and verifiable.

- Physical delivery processes remain flexible and compatible with real-world logistics systems.

- The user experience is seamless, secure, and scalable.

  # 2. Smart Contract Layer
The core of Lyvora’s decentralized logic is implemented through Move-based smart contracts on the SUI blockchain.
### 2.1 Escrow Module
When a buyer completes a purchase, funds are locked in a non-custodial smart contract. The contract autonomously handles:

- Payment locking and verification

- Delivery status monitoring via trusted oracles

- Timed fund release (48-hour window)

- Refunds if shipping is not initiated

- Immutable transaction rules

  All funds remain inaccessible to any party (including Lyvora) until conditions are met.
## 2.2 Dispute Resolution Module
If a buyer opens a dispute, the contract enters a dedicated dispute mode. The module supports:

- Submission of evidence by both parties (via IPFS hash)

- Objective, rule-based evaluation of the evidence

- Consideration of reputation history as a tiebreaker

- Final decision enforced by the smart contract

In future versions, DAO-based arbitration will allow verified arbiters to analyze cases and vote on outcomes, recorded entirely on-chain.
## 2.3 Reputation Module
Each wallet address has a transparent, on-chain reputation profile, updated after every transaction. The score is based on:

- Transaction success rate

- Dispute frequency and outcomes

- Response time

- Direct feedback from verified users

- This system strengthens trust without requiring centralized profiles or KYC.
# 3. Off-Chain Service Layer
While all financial logic is on-chain, Lyvora integrates with external systems to support product delivery and user operations.
## 3.1 SaaS Logistics Integration
Lyvora connects with logistics providers through trusted APIs to:

- Generate shipping labels

- Register tracking codes

- Monitor delivery status in real time

- Trigger on-chain events based on verified delivery

- Shipping data is stored in Lyvora’s backend, and optionally hashed on-chain to preserve auditability.
 ## 3.2 Notification System
Buyers receive automatic updates (email or on-platform) at each stage of the delivery process. These systems are off-chain and do not compromise user funds or on-chain logic.
# 4. Oracle Integration
To connect off-chain events with on-chain logic, Lyvora uses decentralized oracle providers compatible with the SUI blockchain.

 Use cases include:

- Validating delivery confirmation from logistics APIs

- Triggering escrow fund releases or dispute windows

- Submitting tracking updates to smart contracts

- Verifying price conversions (USD ↔ tokens)

Delivery events are recorded on-chain either as full data entries or hashed representations — preserving both verifiability and user privacy.

Future oracle use cases may include:

- Tax rate validation

- Stock availability from vendors

- Dispute signal feeds from external arbiters
  # 5. Data Architecture & Privacy
Lyvora follows a privacy-by-design approach.

On-chain Data:
- Escrow creation and settlement

- Reputation scores and feedback history

- Dispute actions and outcomes

- Oracle-triggered events

Off-chain Data:
- Shipping addresses

- Tracking numbers

- Product photos, videos, and customer support interactions

IPFS Integration:
Any file submitted as part of a dispute (e.g., photo or video) is uploaded via IPFS.
Only the IPFS hash is stored on-chain, ensuring verifiability without exposing sensitive data or increasing gas costs.
