# What is Lyvora?

Lyvora is a decentralized marketplace that offers a new way to buy and sell physical products using blockchain technology.

All payment infrastructure, reputation, and smart contracts operate fully on-chain, ensuring security, transparency, and user autonomy.

To enable the delivery of products in the real world, we integrate APIs from logistics providers (SaaS), forming a hybrid architecture that connects the decentralized ecosystem with global transportation networks.

Unlike centralized platforms such as Amazon or Mercado Livre, Lyvora does not charge abusive fees, does not require mandatory KYC processes, and does not arbitrarily hold user funds. All reputation records are stored on-chain, ensuring transparency and trust.

Our purpose is to give control back to people, allowing anyone to participate in global commerce with autonomy, fairer costs, and the freedom to manage their own assets.

Lyvora is an open-source project. All code is publicly available, so anyone can review, audit, or contribute to its development.

## What problem does it solve?

Lyvora solves the problem of dependency on centralized platforms that charge high fees, control seller access, and can arbitrarily hold funds. In addition, it eliminates the massive collection of users’ personal data that occurs in traditional marketplaces, protecting privacy and reducing the risks of misuse of this information. It also removes geographical barriers and censorship restrictions over the trade of physical products.

# What does it enable?

Lyvora enables anyone to buy and sell physical products in a decentralized way, without relying on centralized platforms that control payments and visibility. Sellers can receive payments directly in cryptocurrency with automatic custody through smart contracts, while buyers have access to a global marketplace without geographical restrictions. All reputation history is recorded on-chain, increasing trust in transactions.

 # What makes it different?
 
Lyvora stands out by not requiring KYC and operating in a fully decentralized way. It does not arbitrarily hold funds or block users. Reputation is recorded on-chain and visible to everyone. The platform charges only a fixed 2.5% fee per transaction and offers cashback rewards to buyers, making commerce more accessible and transparent compared to traditional marketplaces.
