# What is Lyvora?

Lyvora is a decentralized marketplace that offers a new way to buy and sell physical products using blockchain technology.

All payment infrastructure, reputation, and smart contracts operate fully on-chain, ensuring security, transparency, and user autonomy.

To enable the delivery of products in the real world, we integrate APIs from logistics providers (SaaS), forming a hybrid architecture that connects the decentralized ecosystem with global transportation networks.

Unlike centralized platforms such as Amazon or Mercado Livre, Lyvora does not charge abusive fees, does not require mandatory KYC processes, and does not arbitrarily hold user funds. All reputation records are stored on-chain, ensuring transparency and trust.

Our purpose is to give control back to people, allowing anyone to participate in global commerce with autonomy, fairer costs, and the freedom to manage their own assets.

Lyvora is an open-source project. All code is publicly available, so anyone can review, audit, or contribute to its development.
